HELP & INSTRUCTIONS
===================

## General Usage

All elements on the sheet can be clicked directly to edit them. Clicking outside an element saves the change.

## Header (Title, etc.)

Click on "Title", "Subtitle", or "Style" to change the text. While editing, a toolbar will appear at the top, allowing you to adjust the font family and font size.

## Time Signature

Click the time signature (e.g., `4/4`) at the beginning of the sheet to change it. The number of input fields per measure will automatically adjust to the new time signature (e.g., `3/4` will show 3 fields).

## Editing Structure

- **Add New Line:** Click the "Add New Line" button at the bottom left.
- **Delete Line:** Click the large "×" at the end of a line. This button only appears if there is more than one line.
- **Add Measure:** If a line has fewer than four measures, a `+` button will appear at the end of the line to add a new measure.
- **Delete Measure:** Hover over a measure and click the small "×" in the top right corner. This button only appears if a line has more than one measure.

## Editing Content

- **Line Text:** Click in the empty area above a staff line to add annotations like "Intro", "Verse", or "Chorus". 
  - **Rehearsal Mark (First Measure):** Start the line with your mark in square brackets, e.g., `[A] Verse`. The mark will be placed on the first measure, and the brackets will be hidden.
  - **Alignment:** Use `<` to start left-aligned text and `>` to start right-aligned text. Any text not following these markers will be centered. They can be combined on one line.
    - `<Verse`: Aligns "Verse" to the left.
    - `>Chorus`: Aligns "Chorus" to the right.
    - `Intro`: Aligns "Intro" to the center (default).
    - `<Verse 1 >D.S. al Coda`: Aligns "Verse 1" left and "D.S. al Coda" right.
    - `Interlude <Flute Solo`: Aligns "Interlude" center and "Flute Solo" left.
  - **Musical Symbols:** The following are automatically recognized (case-insensitive):
    - `$`: Becomes a Segno sign (𝄋).
    - `Coda`: Becomes a Coda sign (𝄌).
    - `D.S.`: Becomes a Dal Segno sign (𝄉).
    - `D.C.`: Becomes a Da Capo sign (𝄊).

- **Chords in Measure:** Click inside a measure to show the input fields for chords.
  - Enter chord symbols (e.g., `C`, `Gm7`, `D/F#`).
  - Use a slash `/` for a beat.
  - Enter `%` in any field to display a measure repeat symbol.
  - Leave a field empty for a rest on that beat.

- **Endings (Volta Brackets):** Click the 'V' above a bar line to define a start or end point for a bracket. Enter the same label (e.g., `1.`) on the bar line **before** the first measure and **after** the last measure of the section. To remove a bracket, clear the input at both points.

- **Bar Lines:** Click on a bar line to edit it. Enter one of the following symbols:
  - `|` : Single bar line
  - `||` : Double bar line
  - `|<` : Start repeat
  - `>|` or `}` : End repeat
  - `|||` : Final bar line
